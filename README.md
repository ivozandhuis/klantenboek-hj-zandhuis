Data from the 1907 customerregistration of village blacksmith H.J. Zandhuis (1884-1938) in Wijhe (NL)

## Source
In my family a customer registration has survived of blacksmith Harm Jan Zandhuis (1884-1938) in Wijhe, a village in the province of Overijssel in the Netherlands. The fact that it starts halfway May and his age (22) at the time of creation (1907), suggests that it is the year he started to work on his own account. He and his descendends probably kept this oldest customerregistration as a souvenir.

The registration contains an index were the names of customers are alphabetically entered, with a reference to the page were the work he did for this customer was registered. On the page the date, work/product and price is notated.

This dataset contains two tables, one with an overview of the customers and one with the work and product that HJ Zandhuis sold. Based on the minimally available data (sometimes only a familyname) I tried to find more information on the customer in the population registration of the municipality of Wijhe. This is added to the first table. The second table contains the work the blacksmith has done, the date and the price in Dutch guilders (note that in 1907 prices could have half cents, so three decimals are needed). This table refers to the customer in the first table through the pagenumber ('fol').
